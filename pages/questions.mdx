# Questions from Dekan

## Where do you see the product going over the next 12 months? 

From a MVP state weâ€™d like to roll out the app to DAOs and/or people in our network to learn whether it can help them with the decentralized orchestration flow. Ideally, we have an protocol and a product, where you could either use the app or integrate the smart contracts. 
Integration with other DAO tools; [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com), [DeWork](https://dework.xyz/), [HATS](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/), and Collabland all come to mind. 

## How are you building FUX vs other attempts at on-chain workstream 'orchestration flow'?

A quick comparison can be made with [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com), which is not fully on-chain We build FUX as a protocol, so others could connect to our Coordination LEGO and use it to augment reputation, 
availability , evaluation and rewards systems. 
      - Reputation: FUX given combined with value-add evaluation 
      - Availability: How many FUX do you have to give? 
      - Evaluation: Peer evaluation of workstream value-add 
      - Rewards: Receive vFUX and possibly a portion of the funding, relative to the vFUX received 

## Where is the most exciting experimentation in this happening currently? Which projects? What inspires you here?
      - [DeWork](https://dework.xyz/): web3 bounty board but not open-source
      - [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com): peer evaluations but not on-chain 
      - [HATS](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz): distribution of rights and roles

## Is this a passion project? Or are the intentions to try to build FUX into a long term project? 

Intended to be a long-term public goods project to help DAOs, quadratic freelancers and other web3 native entities coordinate, commit and deliver.
