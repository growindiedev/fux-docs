# Introduction
 
Fundamentally we want to work on human coordination. Specifically, we want to help people manage their most valuable asset, their attention. FUX is a tool built for DAOs and 
Individuals to manage attention across varied workstreams and linking compensation directly to value created.
With FUX, workstream coordinators can accurately manage a contributor’s available bandwidth, assess the value generated and disperse compensation relative to value creation.
Contributors can manage their own bandwidth and assess the ability they have to take on new work.

## Why FUX?

The froth of the last bull cycle brought a lot of energy and attention to the web3 world. There was an explosion of ideas from seemingly limitless possibilities backed by abundant capital.
Mismanagement of this attention and overcommitment resulted in countless stories of smart and dedicated contributors burning out, over-promising, and under-delivering. 
DAOs and projects were left with unmanageable timelines and unmet goals. The contributors that fell into this trap were unable to properly account for their attention, 
carried away by passion and possibilities. The project leaders and communities had no way to assess the bandwidth of the contributors they were placing their faith into. 
The ecosystem as a whole suffered.

## What is FUX
FUX Protocol is a tool for individuals and DAOs that will enable the accounting of attention (bandwidth). The FUX flow goes through a commitment stage and then a resolution stage. 
In the commitment stage, individuals will commit portions of their attention to workstreams established by DAOs or projects via the FUX dashboard. This will provide visibility to 
an individual’s allocation of their bandwidth and a sanity step to prevent over-committing. DAO in general and Workstream owners specifically, will create workstreams and invite
collaborators to assign their attention to said workstream. Through the FUXF dashboard managers will be able to see the allocation of potential contributors’ attention before 
entrusting them with their project’s work. 

FUX aims to be a public good for all web3 entities, facilitating coordination, commitment, and delivery processes. It is an onchain and open-source coordination Lego to be integrated 
with other DAO tools.
